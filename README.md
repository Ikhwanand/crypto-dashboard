# Cryptocurrency Dashboard with Technical Analysis and LSTM Predictions

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to visualize cryptocurrency price data, apply various technical analysis indicators, and make future price predictions using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency Selection**: Choose from popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), Ripple (XRP-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), and Solana (SOL-USD).
- **Time Range Selection**: Select different time ranges for the data chart (e.g., 1 day, 5 days, 1 month, etc.).
- **Technical Indicators**: Apply multiple technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Interactive Charts**: Use Plotly for creating interactive candlestick charts and overlaying technical indicators.
- **LSTM Prediction**: Make future price predictions using an LSTM model based on historical data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the dashboard, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `streamlit`, `yfinance`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `ta`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit yfinance pandas plotly ta scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Running the Dashboard

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ikhwanand/crypto-dashboard.git
   cd crypto-dashboard
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

### Sidebar

- **Select Cryptocurrency**: Choose the cryptocurrency you want to analyze from the dropdown menu.
- **Select Time Range**: Choose the time range for the data chart from the dropdown menu.
- **Select Technical Indicators**: Choose one or more technical indicators to apply to the chart.
- **Prediction Settings**:
  - **Forecast Days**: Use the slider to select the number of days you want to forecast into the future.
  - **Predict with LSTM**: Click the button to generate predictions using the LSTM model.

### Main Interface

- **Candlestick Chart**: Displays the selected cryptocurrency's price data in a candlestick format.
- **Technical Indicators**: If selected, the chosen technical indicators will be overlaid on the chart.
- **LSTM Forecast Chart**: Displays both historical prices and the predicted future prices using the LSTM model.

# Cryptocurrency Dashboard with Technical Analysis and LSTM Predictions

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide users with the ability to visualize cryptocurrency price data, apply various technical analysis indicators, and make future price predictions using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The dashboard leverages Plotly for interactive visualizations and the `ta` library for calculating technical indicators.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency Selection**: Choose from popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), Ripple (XRP-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), and Solana (SOL-USD).
- **Time Range Selection**: Select different time ranges for the data chart (e.g., 1 day, 5 days, 1 month, etc.).
- **Technical Indicators**: Apply multiple technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.

## Additional Notes
If you're using predictions please select the data timestamp you want to predict from the dropdown menu atleast one year.

### Data Source

The data used in this dashboard is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

### Model Details

The LSTM model is a basic sequential model built using Keras. It consists of two LSTM layers followed by dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on normalized closing price data with a time step of 60 days.

### Future Improvements

- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation can improve the accuracy of predictions.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore more advanced architectures like GRU or Transformer models for better performance.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate additional features like technical indicators as inputs to the LSTM model.
